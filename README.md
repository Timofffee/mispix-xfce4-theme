# Mispix - Minimalistic theme for XFCE4

![screenshot dark](scr_dark.png)

I needed a minimalistic theme to work on the screen of my small-screen netbook. That's why I created this theme almost from scratch. It looks great on a small screen, as it takes up very little space and looks quite attractive to me. However, it may not look very good on high-resolution screens!! 

A few extra points for a better experience:
* The whole theme is based on the color `#2d2d2d`. You should consider this if you want to adjust all other elements of the environment to this theme.
* The theme is focused on using very small fonts. I recommend using [GohuFont](https://font.gohu.org/) 11px, since I haven't checked how it will look with other fonts.

Perhaps in the future I will add a light version and an adaptive theme, as well as a generator that will allow you to choose the size of the title for a better experience.
